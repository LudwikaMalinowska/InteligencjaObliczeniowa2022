Fantastic Location, Comfortable Accommodation And Friendly Staff
Members of my family and I stayed at The Resident and we had a wonderful experience there. The hotel is modern, in a very convenient location and in a fun area filled with lots of restaurants, coffee shops and in close proximity to Charring Cross station meaning one can get around the city very easily. The reception staff were all friendly and helpful and greeted us with smiles every time we entered or left the hotel.

One night, we bought take outs and they were gracious enough to provide plates, cutlery, water etc. and made us feel at home.

Even though the hotel is located on a busy street, one does not hear any street noise.

There is a mini kitchen in the room that comes with utensils, a fridge and microwave. Makes it easy to have breakfast in the room if you so desire.

The hotel is well kept, clean and we would for sure stay there again. The rooms are a bit small so ask about a room upgrade where they is a little more space to move around.
