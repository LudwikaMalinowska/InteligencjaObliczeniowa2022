Bate and Switch. Extremely disappointed with booking process; forget about trusting them to stay there.
When I contacted the hotel directly through email (twice no less!) regarding their advertised 25% rate reduction for a mutli-night stay; Night desk manager Joel couldn't have been less helpful if he tried. I asked just 3 very specific, direct questions regarding pricing, taxes and exchange rates (theirs was no where near what the website quoted for the same dates- so I asked to see a breakdown of their numbers. Having failed there, I tried again with another contact person and received the same final quote with no additional information. Neither person made any legitimate attempt at being helpful. As a person in front of the public everyday myself, it was a valuable lesson on who not to be when I am representing my company.

How unfortunate; the location is perfect and I was thrilled with the initial 25% reduction offer; which is still being advertised! but apparently unattainable.
